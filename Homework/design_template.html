            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Morgan Boerup</h2>
            <img src="/images/pinterest.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">

            </p>
            <p>
                Pinterest has a good example of proximity. Throughout all of their site, the pictures and words are at a small distance from one another, making it appear close and connected but at an attractive distance. When you click on a picture in Pinterest, the proximity of the picture to the edges of your screen is also the same distance. The small amount of white space is effective as well in the layout of their webpage. Overall, Pinterest’s webpage and app have little difference.

            <h2>Alignment &mdash; Andrea Wagner</h2>

                Unsplash.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Alignment is displayed in this website because all of the names of those posting pictures are left indented, the navigation bar is neatly organized, and the elements of the page are not center indented. This site has done a good job of ensuring that the audience can easily access all elements of the page without having to search or scroll extensively. The icons at the top have been reduced from words to items to help the mobile functionality of the site. Alignment is also seen in the placement, size, and locations of the pictures on the page. They are all neatly lined up with one another and follow the same sizing system.

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; Jefté Munoz</h2>

            <p>
                Repetition is the reusing of the same or similar element throughout the design. Good repetition, seeks to repeat some aspects of a design throughout a piece of work, be it for a simple or complex piece of work. In this instance the "piece of work" is a website. These images show the Envision Healthcare Holdings main page, their Who We Are page, and a page specially for Investors. We may see in each of these that their use of the principle of repetition is in their companie's name and logo, stock value, menu and search bar.

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Kristina Darroch</h2>
            <img src="/images/lush.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
            <p>
                Lushusa.com
            </p>
            <p>
                The design principal of contrast is excellently portraid in this webpage by the seamless and modern looking black content against the white web page. Lush cosmetics products are often very colorful and provide a very vivid contrast in the web page. The contrast also allows for an easier user interface by easily leading the user to where they can learn more or purchase an item.

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Joseph Walker</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
                This page's words are in a simple sans-serif font and make it easy to read the content, which in this case is movie titles and compressed information about them. The title fonts are black and bolded while the less relevant content is in smaller grey font style.This makes it easier for the user to find the information they are looking for faster.
